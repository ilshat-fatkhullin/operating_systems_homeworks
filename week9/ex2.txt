There are two different ways to decrease hit ratio:

The first, most primitive one, is just to constuct a sequence, which always references frames, that are not in physical memory table.

For example:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20...

Since current sequence references unique frame at each clock, at the moment, when physical memory table will overflow it needs to replace one of its cell.

The second way is to break expectations that last recently used frame will be referenced in the near future:

So if number of frames in our physical memory is 5, we have:
1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6...

One of the ways to increase hit ratio is to meet our expectations that last recently used frame will be referenced in the near future:

For number of frames equals to 5 we have:
1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 5 6

To have the best hit rate case we shouldn't make any replacements at all:

For number of frames equals to 5 we have:
5 3 4 1 5 2 3 4 5 2 3 1
